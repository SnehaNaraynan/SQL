## Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart sales data sourced from Kaggle to uncover key business insights. The workflow involves:

1) Loading the dataset into VS Code using Kaggle API.

2) Cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).

3) Connecting PostgreSQL using psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy.

4) Running SQL queries on the cleaned dataset to extract business insights.

Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries & Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Psycopg2, SQLAlchemy

Database: PostgreSQL

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets

The dataset consists of Walmart sales records with the following columns:

date: Date of transaction

branch: Store location

payment_method: Type of payment used

category: Product category

unit_price: Price per unit

quantity: Quantity sold

rating: Customer rating

time: Time of transaction

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes the following transformations:

Data Inspection: Check shape, types, duplicates, and missing values.

Handling Missing Values:

Convert unit_price from object to float.

Fill missing unit_price and quantity with mean values.

Duplicate Removal: Identified and dropped 51 duplicate rows.

Feature Engineering:

Created total column: total = unit_price * quantity.

Database Setup

The cleaned dataset is stored in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.

Business Insights were gathered using SQL queries in Postgresql/Mysql
